Directives - HTML annotations that trigger javascript behaviors
Modules - where our application components live
Expressions - how values get displayed on a page
Controllers - where we add application behavior

Wrap our javascript app in a closure - good habit.

More directives
~ ng-app
~ ng-controller
~ ng-show
~ ng-hide
~ ng-repeat

Pipe | take the output of an expression and pipe it into the filter

Recipe: {{ data | filter:options}}

Filters: date, lowercase, uppercase, limitTo, orderBy

ng-src directive - example: <img ng-src="{{product.images[0]}.full}}" - if we had
just used src, the browser would have tried to load the image before the expression
was evaluated.

ng-click directive - used with tabs, takes an expression to evaluate, e.g.
ng-click="tab = 1"

<section>
  <ul class="nav nav-pills">
    <li><a href ng-click="tab = 1">Description</a></li>
    <li><a href ng-click="tab = 2">Specifications</a></li>
    <li><a href ng-click="tab = 3">Reviews</a></li
  </ul>
  {{tab}}

When ng-click changes the value of tab, the {{tab}} expression automatically
gets updated
==> This is two-way data binding
