Sample application create by following along with the videos in the
Code School Angular JS course, linked to from the Angular site.

Note that once the use of ng-include or custom directives is reached,
instead of loading the page as a file, run this in the main directory:

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Then access the app via http, e.g. http://localhost:8000/gemstore.html
